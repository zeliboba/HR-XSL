  <dt><font size="3">Great!! now that you have downloaded OAGIS 8.0 and unzipped
    it. It's time to look around... OAGIS 8.0 includes documentation, XML
    Schemas, example XML Instance documents, Constraint Rules, Constraint
    Stylesheets all of which is viewable from the documentation. However if you
    really want to use OAGIS, as with any complex XML Schema application, you
    need an XML IDE. (There are several available.) and a XML Parser the
    supports XML Schema, and an XSL Processor. The Utility folder includes
    several of these to get you started, see the <a href="../../Utility/bin/_readme.htm" target="body">_readme.htm</a>
    in the Utility\bin directory</font></dt>
</dl>
<p>We have provided an XML Spy project file that can be used to view OAGIS. This
is the &quot;OAGIS 8.0.spp&quot; located in the OAGIS 8.0 directory.</p>

<p>If you are looking to integrate business applications, business units or
supply chains and don't know where to begin. Start with the OAGIS Scenarios.
These provide several example integration using the OAGIS. Once you find one
that matches or somewhat matches you needs it is easy to identify the BODs that
are needed for your integration. </p>
<p>If you already now the message that you need to exchange look for the message
in the OAGIS Documentation. Remember OAGIS is a horizontal specification and as
such we may not call a BOD or an field the same. It is important to look at the
semantic meaning and not just the tag name.</p>
<p>If you find that you need an additional BOD(s), contact <a href="mailto:xml@openapplications.org">xml@openapplications.org</a>.
